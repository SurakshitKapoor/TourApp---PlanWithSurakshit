# TourApp---PlanWithSurakshit
this is a web page of a tour site, created using React.js technologies.
In this React.js technology based web page, i tried to build a real-world project to showcase the functunilities of React framework.
On the main page, there are many cards showing the details about the tour site attached with buttons. 
if user click the not interested button attached to that corresponding card, then that card entry will get remove from web page.
